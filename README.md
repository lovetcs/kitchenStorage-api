# KitchenStorage API
KitchenStorage API is a Java Spring Boot application designed to manage kitchen inventory. The application is deployed on an AWS EC2 instance and utilizes Amazon DynamoDB for data storage. Continuous integration and deployment are automated using GitHub Actions.

## üöÄ Features
- **Inventory Management**: Efficiently track and manage kitchen items.
- **RESTful API**: Provides endpoints for CRUD operations on kitchen inventory items.
- **Expiration Tracking**: Monitor and notify about items nearing expiration.
- **Category Management**: Organize items by custom categories.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
The application follows a microservices architecture with the following components:
- **Spring Boot Application**: Handles business logic and exposes RESTful endpoints.
- **Amazon DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for scalable and flexible data storage.
- **AWS EC2 Instance**: Hosts the Spring Boot application, ensuring high availability.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates the build, test, and deployment processes.

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 11 or higher
- **AWS Account**: Access to AWS services like EC2 and DynamoDB
- **GitHub Repository**: Fork or clone the [KitchenStorage API repository](https://github.com/lovetcs/kitchenStorage-api)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions
### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lovetcs/kitchenStorage-api.git
cd kitchenStorage-api
```
## 2. Configure AWS Credentials
Create an AWS IAM user with appropriate permissions and configure credentials:
```bash
aws configure
Enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, default region, and output format when prompted.
```
## 3. Configure Application Properties
Copy the sample properties file and update with your configuration:
```bash
cp src/main/resources/application.properties.sample src/main/resources/application.properties
```
